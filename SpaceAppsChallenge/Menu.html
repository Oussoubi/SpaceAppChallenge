	<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Humans have explored our planet for centuries, and have more or less discovered every part of it. 
		And we believe we will continue to do so for many more centuries to come, only this time it will be outside of our planet, 
		in space. Just the tought of that is exciting, and the nearest star which is the sun has had a massive impact on 
		humanity till this day. For decades scientists have wondered the origins of solar wind and its different 
		forms, and more.</p>

	<h2>The importance of understanding the Sun</h2>

	<h2>How does solar wind affect human activity on Earth? </h2>
	
		<h3>Traveling through our space environment </h3>
		<p>Since the solar wind fills the space between the planets, it is important to know its main characteristics 
		when we want to travel through this environment with spacecraft. The solar wind is a determining factor for the 
		immediate environment of the Earth.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, our Earth has a magnetic field that can stop the biggest part of the charged particles of the solar wind. 
		Yet, some of these particles are able to enter the atmosphere, where they cause, for example, polar lights. </p>
		
		<h3>Solar wind storms causing power failure and satellite break downs </h3>
		<p>Once in a while "storms" also occur. In 1991, as a consequence of such a storm, large parts of Canada and the United States 
		experienced a major power failure. Variations in the solar wind cause electric storms and corrosion in the many kilometer long 
		pipelines of Alaska. </p>
		<p>Storms disturb radio transmissions, and also space travel has to deal with certain consequences. The charged particles
		of the solar wind can be compared to radioactive radiation. It isn't the first time that a satellite breaks down due to 
		the intense radiations during a storm.</p>
