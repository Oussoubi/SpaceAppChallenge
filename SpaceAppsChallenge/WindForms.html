		<h2>Solar Wind</h2>
		<p>Geophysical research in the nineteenth century associated variations in the earth's magnetic field with the roughly 11-year variation
		in the number of observable sunspots found on the disk of the Sun. By the 1950's transient effects in the solar atmosphere had been identified
		as the causes of short term variations in the earth's magnetic field and the ionospheric configuration. From these effects
		and theoretical work conducted at the same period of time, it was understood that the Sun must be constantly emitting
		a flow of charged particles which sweep past the earth. Such a wind of charged particles was identified with early experiments
		on spacecraft, beginning in the 1960s.</p> 
		<p>The solar wind is now know to be a mixture of materials found in the solar plasma, composed of ionized hydrogen 
		(electrons and protons) with an 8% component of helium and trace amounts of heavy ions. The solar wind has been detected 
		inward toward the sun to the orbit of Mercury,and outward past the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. The flux of particles is modulated
		by the pressure (both magnetic and thermal) at the base of the wind in the solar corona, and to a certain extent, some of the 
		features of the solar wind, particularlly in the case of high speed streams, can be identified with specific large scale coronal 
		features, the coronal hole structures.</p> 
		<p>At the orbit of the earth the average solar wind consists of a strongly ionized gas having a proton and electron density of about
		3 - 10 particles per cubic centimeter, with an average flow velocity of approximately 400 km/s. Occasionally stream structures are 
		detected in the steady solar wind, which have peak velocities which tend toward a mean of about 750 km/s near the earth. 
		Occasionally impulsive events are detected with peak velocities in excess of 1000 km/s. Assuming a brief period of acceleration in the
		low corona, material in the normal solar wind near the equator reaches the earth about 4 days after departing from the Sun. 
		Temperatures of the plasma at the earth are found to be about 150,000°K, approximately a factor of ten lower than the estimates for 
		the temperatures of the bulk of the coronal plasma found in the upper atmosphere of the Sun. </p>
		
		<h2>Is solar wind power the future of renewable energy ?</h2>
		<p>As the world’s energy needs inevitably grow, we must become less reliant on fossil fuels and strive to find sources of 
		alternative energy. Solar, geothermal, tidal and wind power are some of the more common sources of alternative energy. 
		However, another source of alternative energy has caught the attention of fusion researchers, which reportedly has the potential to
		meet the world’s energy needs 100 billion times over. This potential energy generating power house is solar wind power.</p>
		
		<h2>What is solar wind and how can we harness it? </h2>
		<p>Solar wind is streams of hot and fast magnetised gas from the sun’s upper atmosphere. It is comprised of hydrogen and helium ions 
		along with some other heavier elements. It’s similar to the steam from a boiling kettle, however, solar wind does not behave exactly
		the same. Normal steam would rise quickly and slow down as it cools, but as solar wind leaves the Sun it accelerates, tripling in 
		speed through the aura of plasma that surrounds the Sun, also known as the corona. Furthermore, as the solar wind moves into cold 
		space something inside it continues to add heat. This ‘something’ has long been seen as a mystery, until recent data posited ion 
		cyclotron waves as the source.</p> 
		<p>Solar wind does not act like you would expect wind to on Earth. Instead of using wind turbines, it would have to be collected 
		using a gigantic sail which would be deployed in space, between the Sun and the Earth. The solar wind sail would function by pointing
		a 4 inch wide copper wire, which is attached to the sail, at the Sun. This would then create a magnetic field that captures electrons 
		found in solar wind, which would then be funnelled to a spherical receiver, producing a current. This current would then have to be 
		transferred to collector stations on either satellites, the moon or Earth via a powerful infrared laser beam. A network of satellites
		which transfer the energy to collectors on Earth would be the most cost effective way of harnessing the energy as opposed to setting
		up a station on the moon.</p>
		<p>However, even though there are huge potential gains to be had from solar wind, there are also still some rather large obstacles 
		that would have to be overcome in order for this to become a reality. Below are the potential advantages and disadvantages of 
		solar wind:</p>
		
		<h3>Advantages </h3>
		<ul>
		<li>We already possess the technology to build the satellites as they would be made up mostly of copper and are relatively 
		easy to construct.</li>
		<li>They have the potential to produce 100 billion times as much power as the Earth currently needs</li>
		<li>It could be set up on a small scale. A 1cm wide copper wire which is 300m long, a receiver 2m wide and sail 10 metres wide could 
		generate 1.7 megawatts of power, enough to power around 1000 homes</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>The biggest obstacle to overcome is how to get the power back to earth. A laser beam would be the best solution, however there
		would be millions of miles between the satellite and Earth meaning that the beam would widen and lose energy</li>
		<li>In order to harness the full potential of the solar wind, the solar sail would have to be 8,400-kilometres (5,220 miles) 
		wide, which would be hard to achieve. </li>
		<li>It will rely on constant solar wind, which would mean the satellite would have to be situated tens of 
		millions of miles from Earth</li>
		
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>Whilst we currently have the technology to build the solar sail, the real problem lies in how to get the energy back down to Earth 
		efficiently. If we can harness this energy then it will effectively mean we no longer need to be reliant on fossil fuels, which 
		will in turn help to slow down climate change and ultimately reduce the destruction of our planet's ecosystems. However, until we 
		have the complete technology to efficiently capture solar wind then we will just have to make do with other forms of renewable energy</p>
