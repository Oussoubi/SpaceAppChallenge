	<p>We will be discussing 2 solar missions: Parker Solar Probe, and Solar Orbiter</p>
		<h2>The Parker Solar Probe</h2>
		<h3>Facts about the Parker Solar Probe</h3>
		<p>After nearly three years in space, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has not only made numerous passes around our fiery orb, 
		inching closer to the Sun than any spacecraft before it, but it has also ushered in discoveries that are shaping scientists’ 
		understanding of Earth’s star. For its efforts to untangle the long-standing mysteries of the complex solar environment, the Parker
		Solar Probe team has earned the National Space Club and Foundation’s Nelson P. Jackson Award, which recognizes the most outstanding 
		contribution to aerospace in the preceding year.</p>
		<p>“Goddard scientists are proud to work together with the diverse Parker Solar Probe science teams from universities and research 
		laboratories, leading to groundbreaking discoveries of how our Sun shapes our space environment,” said Dr. Adam Szabo, mission 
		scientist for Parker Solar Probe at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The Parker Solar Probe spacecraft 
		has successfully endured the brutal conditions near the Sun’s corona with the help of its cutting-edge heat shield, water-cooled 
		solar panels and high-precision guidance and autonomy systems, allowing for unprecedented and long-awaited close-up observations of 
		our star.</p>
		<p>These observations are addressing questions that puzzled scientists for decades, such as how the Sun’s corona is heated and 
		how the solar wind accelerates away from the Sun to inevitably impact our environment on Earth. The Parker Solar Probe team has 
		started piecing that puzzle together, thanks to the intrepid spacecraft and its suite of instruments, which have given scientists 
		hints at the previously unseen dust-free zone surrounding the Sun, as well as front-seat views of the turbulent activity near the Sun.
		For example, the magnetic field embedded in the solar wind – the Sun’s constant outflow of material – whips back on itself until it 
		is pointed in the opposite direction in a phenomenon dubbed “switchbacks.” Along with observations of other plasma phenomena, Parker
		Solar Probe is helping scientists understand what drives energetic particle storms and coronal mass ejections, major events that can
		reverberate across the solar system and even on Earth. “This recognition is another testament to the mission’s success and reflects 
		how important it is to study not only the Sun and its immediate environment, but pursue space exploration in general, as the science
		community continues pushing the boundaries of space research,” said Parker Solar Probe Project Scientist Dr. Nour Raouafi, of the 
		Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. “Parker Solar Probe is exceeding all expectations, and the 
		mission’s science return has just been amazing.”</p>
		<p>Parker Solar Probe — named for Dr. Eugene Parker, who first theorized the concept of the solar wind in the 1950s — launched in
		August 2018 and is on its way to completing 24 passes around the Sun, eventually moving within 4 million miles of the solar surface.
		During its most recent close approach to the Sun, called perihelion, in April 2021, Parker Solar Probe broke its own records for 
		solar proximity and speed, coming within about 6.5 million miles (10.4 million kilometers) of the Sun’s surface while moving faster
		than 330,000 miles per hour (532,000 kilometers per hour).</p>
		<p>Parker Solar Probe is part of NASA’s Living with a Star program to explore aspects of the Sun-Earth system that directly affect
		life and society. The Living with a Star program is managed by the agency’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, for
		NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, 
		manages the Parker Solar Probe mission for NASA and designed, built, and operates the spacecraft.
		The National Space Club and Foundation bridges industry and government to foster excellence in space activity.
		A panel of experts spanning the aerospace and defense industries, government and academia selected the Parker Solar Probe mission 
		for the honor, which is named for the club’s founder and past president, Nelson Pete Jackson. Last year’s award went to the Event 
		Horizon Telescope Collaboration team for the first picture of a black hole, taken on April 10, 2019.</p>

		
		<h2>The Solar Orbiter</h2>
		<p>Solar Orbiter is an international cooperative mission between ESA (the European Space Agency) and NASA that addresses a 
		central question of heliophysics: How does the Sun create and control the constantly changing space environment throughout 
		the solar system? The Sun creates what’s known as the heliosphere — a giant bubble of charged particles and magnetic fields 
		blown outward by the Sun that stretches more than twice the distance to Pluto at its nearest edge, enveloping every planet in our 
		solar system and shaping the space around us. To understand it, Solar Orbiter is traveling as close as 26 million miles from the 
		Sun, inside the orbit of Mercury to measure the magnetic fields, waves, energetic particles and plasma escaping the Sun while they
		are still in their pristine state, before being modified and mixed in their long journey from the Sun.</p>
		<p>With a scientific payload of 10 different instruments — each complementing and supporting the others — Solar Orbiter combines 
		high-resolution telescopes with measurements from the environment directly surrounding the spacecraft. Together the observations 
		create a one-of-a-kind, comprehensive picture of the Sun's inner workings and how they can affect the space environment further out
		in the solar system. Solar Orbiter launched from Cape Canaveral on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 411 rocket on 
		Feb. 9, 2020 at 11:03 p.m. EST. It now follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, completing one revolution every 168 days.
		Using gravity assists from Venus and Earth, Solar Orbiter is gradually lifting itself out of the ecliptic plane, ultimately reaching 
		an angle of 24 degrees above the Sun’s equator (33 degrees for the extended mission). From this vantage point Solar Orbiter is
		capturing the first ever images of the Sun’s north and south poles from high latitudes. At its fastest, Solar Orbiter can almost 
		catch up to the Sun’s rate of rotation, allowing the spacecraft to hover over specific spots on the Sun as it turns and study how 
		a single solar feature evolves over time.</p>
		<p>Solar Orbiter joins NASA’s Parker Solar Probe in studying our star from closer than any spacecraft before them. Working together, 
		Solar Orbiter's comprehensive suite of instruments and NASA’s Parker Solar Probe's up-close view of the Sun provide a 
		never-before-seen global view of our star.  Various conjunctions of the two missions over their life spans allow observations along 
		different points of the same magnetic field lines and outflow of material, or allow one mission to provide a larger context view of 
		the space the other one is traveling through. </p>
		<h3>Its features</h3>
		<p>The Solar Orbiter spacecraft is a Sun-pointed, three-axis stabilised platform with a dedicated heat shield to provide protection 
		from the high levels of solar flux near perihelion. The spacecraft provides a stable platform to accommodate the combination of 
		remote-sensing and in situ instrumentation in an electromagnetically clean environment. The 21 sensors were configured on the 
		spacecraft to allow each to conduct its in situ or remote-sensing experiments with both access to and protection from the solar 
		environment. Solar Orbiter has inherited technology from previous missions, such as the solar arrays from the BepiColombo Mercury 
		Planetary Orbiter (MPO). The solar arrays can be rotated about their longitudinal axis to avoid overheating when close to the Sun.
		A battery pack provides supplementary power at other points in the mission such as eclipse periods encountered during planetary flybys.
		The Telemetry, Tracking and Command Subsystem provides the communication link capability with the Earth in X-band.</p> 
		<p>The subsystem supports telemetry, telecommand and ranging. Low-Gain Antennas are used for Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) 
		and now function as a back-up during the mission phase when steerable Medium- and High-Gain Antennas are in use. The High-Temperature 
		High-Gain Antenna needs to point to a wide range of positions to achieve a link with the ground station and to be able to downlink sufficient
		volumes of data. Its design was adapted from the BepiColombo mission. The antenna can be folded in to gain protection from 
		Solar Orbiter's heat shield if necessary. Most data will therefore initially be stored in on-board memory and sent back to 
		Earth at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
		
		<h3> Objective of the Solar Orbiter</h3>
		<p>To perform close-up, high-resolution studies of our Sun and inner heliosphere, Solar Orbiter is intended to brave the fierce 
		heat and carry its telescopes to just one-quarter of Earth's distance from our nearest star.</p>

		<h3>Mission<h3>
		<p>ESA’s Solar Orbiter mission is conceived to perform a close-up study of our Sun and inner heliosphere - the uncharted innermost
		regions of our Solar System - to better understand, and even predict, the unruly behaviour of the star on which our lives depend. 
		At its closest point, the spacecraft will be within the orbit of Mercury, braving the fierce heat to provide unique data and imagery
		of the Sun.</p>
		<p>Solar Orbiter will be the first satellite to provide close-up views of the Sun's polar regions, which are very difficult to see 
		from Earth, providing images from high latitudes. It will also be able to see solar storms building up over an extended period from 
		the same viewpoint, delivering data of parts of the Sun not visible from Earth.</p>
